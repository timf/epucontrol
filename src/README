Testing/development
===================

# Sample, only works from topdir:

$ source src/env.sh
$ nosetests --nologcapture -x -v -w src/python/epucontrol/main

During (test driven) development this can be conveniently combined with:

$ ./sbin/cat-latest-logfile.sh

... in order to view the log output from the last-run test.
