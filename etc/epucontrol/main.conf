# You will in normal cases not alter the following settings.
#
# [otherconfs] settings control how all of the other configuration files are
# loaded into the program.  The program only needs to know about this current
# file ("main.conf") and will look in the following section ("otherconfs") for
# paths to other configuration files.  These could be absolute paths, if they
# are relative (as they are by default) the program looks in the same directory
# it read the "main.conf" file from.
